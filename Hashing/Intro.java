Let's say we have to find the details of a person by using phone numbers. then this is the 
search operation. T.C is O(1).
To insert new phone number then this is called insertion number.if the values is already exit 
then this insertion will over ride the previous value.O(1).
delete function simply deleting the key and its corresponding value in a hash table.O(1).


//Storing data in sorted way then-:
1.search is O(logn).
2. Insert become O(n).
3.delete become O(n).
//Storing data in unsorted way then-:
1.Insert and delete become O(1). & search become O(n).
