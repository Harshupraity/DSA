//It is the divide and conquere mwthod ..
//The key function is partition of an array..
//worst case time:O(n2)
//Despite O(n2) worst case, it is considered faster than merge sort,because of the following reasons.
//a.In-place.
//b.Cache Friendly
//c.Average case is O(nlogn).
//d.Tail Recursive.

//Partition is key function(Naive(stable),lomuto(unstable),hoare(unstable)).

//NOTE -: If you need stability. then merge sort is prefer. else quick sort
