//In Best case Analysis T(n) = 2T(n/2) + theta(n); O(nlog2n)
//In worst case Analysis T(n) = T(n-1) + theta(n); O(n2)
//Average case Analysis T(n) = O(nlogn);

//And on random it has T(n) = O(nlog2n)..

//Auxiliary Space...
//Best case analysis = In Best case the height of the recursion tree height is minimum when the partition of tree is equal. .
// And the Height of the recursion tree is (log n+1) where n is the length of the array.
//And similarly in T.C it is best when the partition is equal.
